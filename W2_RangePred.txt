During this project, several improvisations were made to enhance model accuracy, data understanding, and analytical quality:
1.Problem Statement Definition:
Defined the core objective — to analyze electric vehicle (EV) specifications and predict
 their driving range (in km) based on technical and design parameters. This focused 
approach helped align the project towards understanding which features most influence EV range.

2.Dataset Selection and Preparation:
Used the Electric Vehicles Specification 2025 dataset, which includes 
detailed vehicle attributes such as battery capacity, efficiency, torque, charging power, and dimensions.
The dataset was cleaned by removing columns with high missing values, imputing numeric
and categorical gaps, and ensuring consistent data types for analysis.

3.Feature Engineering:
Explored correlations among variables to identify the strongest predictors of range, 
including battery capacity, top speed, and fast-charging power. 
Created a refined feature set that improved the predictive performance of the models.

4.Model Optimization:
Implemented and compared multiple models — Simple Linear Regression, Multivariate Linear Regression,
and Random Forest Regression. After optimization, the Random Forest model achieved the 
highest accuracy with an R² score of 0.9555, predicting EV range with an average error of approximately ±16 km.

5.Visualization and Result Interpretation:
Developed correlation heatmaps and feature importance plots to visualize how 
different specifications affect EV range. Summarized model performance metrics (MSE, MAE, and R²) 
in a comparison table for a clear and transparent evaluation of results.
